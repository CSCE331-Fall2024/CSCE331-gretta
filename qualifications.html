        <h3>
          Technical Skills
        </h3>
        <p>
          As a Computer Science major at Texas A&M University, I began my coding journey with Python. 
          In that engineering computation class, I learned the basics of coding, catching onto the concepts 
          quickly. I applied those newfound concepts in class assignments, individual assignments and group 
          projects in this course as well as math classes. From there, I took a program design and concepts 
          course where I learned C++ and the basics of object-oriented programming, applying them to class 
          assignments. We used 2D arrays and memory allocation in a fun game we created in that course; it 
          was called Dungeon Crawler. That semester, I took part in a Hackathon where I exercised my 
          problem-solving skills and worked with HTML and CSS for the first time, helping create a website 
          for our project. I began my Graphic Design minor that semester where I have worked with Adobe 
          Illustrator, InDesign, and Photoshop on personal projects such as a card game design and a brand 
          identity. Additionally, I learned about discrete structures for computing, preparing me for the 
          data structures and algorithms course I would take next. The data structures and algorithms 
          course is my favorite course I have taken so far. It was extremely challenging and interesting. 
          In that course, we implemented data structures and algorithms into C++, ones that both are and 
          are not already preexisting in C++.  Concurrently with the data structures and algorithms course, 
          I learned about computer organization information, learning to understand Assembly in that course. 
          I also learned about Scheme and Java in another course that semester, touching on both in one 
          semester. Over the summer, I explored Java a bit more through the tech camp I worked at, as I 
          worked with Minecraft modding in Java. This semester, I will be deepening my knowledge in 
          preexisting coding languages through both a computer systems course and software engineering 
          foundations course. So far, I have gotten to work more with C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript this semester.

          Technical Areas of Interest
        </h3>
        <p>
          My technical areas of interest mostly consist of a desire to pursue a mix of UX/UI and 
          front end software engineering. Recently I have greatly enjoyed working on a brand identity 
          and a card game design. These design elements are extremely fun, and I spend a lot of time working on 
          them in the Adobe Suite. I have greatly enjoyed learning to code and program in school as well, enjoying 
          a challenge, especially all the ones presented to me in my data structures and algorithms class. It was 
          confusing but super fun to learn and understand the different types of algorithms, runtimes, and sorting methods.
