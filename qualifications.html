          Courses and Skills
        </h3>
        <p>
          As a Computer Science major at Texas A&M University, I began my coding journey with Python. In that 
          engineering computation class, I learned the basics of coding, catching onto the concepts quickly. I 
          applied those newfound concepts in class assignments, individual assignments, and group projects in 
          this course as well as math classes.
        </p>
        <p>
          From there, I took a program design and concepts course where I learned C++ and the basics of 
          object-oriented programming. We used 2D arrays and memory allocation in a fun Dungeon Crawler game 
          we programmed in that course. That semester, I took part in a Hackathon where I exercised my 
          problem-solving skills and worked with HTML and CSS for the first time, helping create a website for 
          our project. I began my Graphic Design minor that semester as well; I have worked with Adobe Illustrator, 
          InDesign, and Photoshop on projects such as a card game design and a brand identity. Additionally, I 
          learned about discrete structures for computing, preparing me for the data structures and algorithms 
          course I would take next.
        </p>
        <p>
          The data structures and algorithms course has been my favorite course so far. It was extremely 
          challenging and interesting. In that course, we implemented data structures and algorithms into 
          C++. Concurrently with this course, I learned about computer organization, focusing on computer 
          system basics. In this course we learned about machine level programming, virtual memory, cache 
          memory, and more, teaching me about the Assembly programming language along the way. I also 
          learned about Scheme and Java in another course that semester. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the summer, I worked at iD Tech, where I served as a course instructor, teaching children 
          how to with mod in Minecraft using Java. I also taught a Java basics class at this camp. This 
          experience allowed me to explore Java a bit more and understand the syntax better compared to C++. 
        </p>

        <p>
          This semester, I will be deepening my preexisting knowledge in coding languages through both a 
          computer systems course and software engineering foundations course. So far, I have gotten to 
          work more with C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript this semester.

          Aspiring Front-End Developer
        </h3>
        <p>
          Ultimately in my career, I desire to pursue a mix of UX/UI and front-end software engineering. Recently in 
          my Graphic Design classes, I have greatly enjoyed working on both a brand identity called "Meow Meow Matcha" 
          and a card game design called "Bake Bash." These design projects are extremely fun, and I spend a lot of 
          time working on them in the Adobe Suite. I also have a great passion for coding and programming, as I have 
          always been math minded and enjoy a challenge. My favorite Computer Science course so far has been my data 
          structures and algorithms class. It was an extremely rigorous course but super fun to learn and understand 
          the different types of algorithms, runtimes, and sorting methods.
