      SMYRT
    </h3>
    <p>
      My main way of giving back to the community has consisted of taking part in an organization at St. Mary's 
      Catholic Center called SMYRT, which stands for St. Mary's Youth Retreat Team. Within SMYRT, I have been formed 
      by leadership and speakers to prepare me and my peers for retreats. I have staffed a few retreats and will be a 
      retreat leader next semester. We put on multiple retreats every semester at locations about 2 or less hours away from 
      College Station, TX. The retreats are Catholic retreats held for middle or high schoolers. They serve to help deepen 
      the faith of the youth so that they can make an impact on the world.

    <h3>
      Connect
    </h3>
    <p>
      Another way I have given back to my community is serving on staff for the St. Mary's Connect retreat. This is a retreat 
      held every year to welcome new students to College Station, especially the St. Mary's community. It provides the 
      students with fellowship, opportunities to grow in their faith, and ways to get involved at St. Mary's. I attended 
      Connect as a freshman, and have gotten the opportunity to run slides for the retreat the past two years, helping the 
      retreat to run smoothly.
