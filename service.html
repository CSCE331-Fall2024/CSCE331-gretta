      SMYRT

    <p>
      The main way I give back to my community is through SMYRT, which stands for St. Mary's Youth Retreat Team. 
      SMYRT is a team that puts on retreats every school year for Catholic parishes within two hours of College Station, TX.
      Within this organization, I have been formed and prepared for retreats through activities and talks lead by SMYRT 
      leadership and speakers. I have staffed a few retreats and will be a retreat leader next semester, where I will 
      have the opportunity to help lead teenagers towards Christ with the help of SMYRT leadership. 
      We serve to help deepen the faith of the youth so that they can make an impact on the world.

    <h3>
      Connect
    </h3>
    <p>
      Another way I have given back to my community is by serving on staff for the St. Mary's Connect retreat. This is a retreat 
      held every year to welcome new students to College Station, especially the St. Mary's community. It provides the 
      students with fellowship, opportunities to grow in their faith, and ways to get involved at St. Mary's. I attended 
      Connect as a freshman, and have gotten the opportunity to run slides for the retreat the past two years, where I have 
      been able to help the retreat run smoothly.
