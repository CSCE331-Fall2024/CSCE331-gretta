        <p>
          The main way I give back to my community is through SMYRT, which stands for St. Mary's Youth Retreat Team. 
          SMYRT is a team that puts on retreats every school year for Catholic parishes within two hours of College Station, TX.
          Within this organization, I have been formed and prepared for retreats through activities and talks lead by SMYRT 
          leadership and speakers. I have staffed a few retreats and will be a retreat leader next semester, where I will 
          have the opportunity to help lead teenagers towards Christ with the help of SMYRT leadership. 
          We serve to help deepen the faith of the youth so that they can make an impact on the world.

      Connect
    </h3>
    <p>
      Another way I have given back to my community is by serving on staff for the St. Mary's Connect retreat. This is a retreat 
      held every year to welcome new students to College Station, especially the St. Mary's community. It provides the 
      students with fellowship, opportunities to grow in their faith, and ways to get involved at St. Mary's. I attended 
      Connect as a freshman, and have gotten the opportunity to run slides for the retreat the past two years, where I have 
      been able to help the retreat run smoothly.

    <h3>
      The Pines
    </h3>
    <p>
      I have attened the Pines Catholic Camp since 2015, and it has always been my happy place. 
      In 2022, I finally had the pleasure of serving on staff. I worked at the Pines for five weeks 
      that summer, helping behind the scenes with a group of 21 other recent high school graduates. During 
      the whole summer of 2023 and one week during this past summer, I was blessed to get to have served as a counselor. 
      Being a counselor has always been my dream, and I got to help girls grow deeper in their faith through discussions 
      based on spiritual talks. In these roles, I got the opportunity to give back to the community that has formed me in my faith and helped 
      me to grow into the person I am today.
